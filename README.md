## Overview

Small demo app to to teach myself contextApi. 

## Getting started

Clone the repository onto your machine and install packages with `npm install`.
I built this project in react 18.2.0. I have used both redux and hooks extensively in the past but this has been my first time using contextApi - something I've been wanting to try out for a while.
The components have been styled responsively using TailwindCss; please try the app out at full screen and mobile screen widths.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

There are currently unit tests for the api actions and the application context.
